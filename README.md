## Some Simple Games ##
My 7 year old daughter and 6 year old son thought it would be cool if we
started making some games. I decided that I would teach them to program
through some really simple games that they thought would be fun. The
first one we thought of was this game. They've been playing it a lot and
seem to really enjoy figuring out how to make it work and playing it.

I am very open to people adding some more games. For the pull request to
be accepted they will need to be very simple in execution. Tests will
likely be added soon as I get time. If you want to beat me to it feel
free.
